# Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have atmost two children, which are refered to as left child and right child.

The topmost nodes are called roots.

The bottom most nodes are called leaves.

## Binary Tree Traversal
- Depth First Search - Tree Traversal using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm can be further classified into three categories:
    - Preorder Traversal (current-left-right)
    - Inorder Traversal (left-current-right)
    - Postorder Traversal (left-right-current)
- Breadth First Search

## Binary Tree Properties
- The maximum number of nodes at level l is 2 ^ l.
- The maximum number of nodes of a binary tree of height h is (2 ^ h) - 1.
- In a binary tree with n nodes the minimum height of binary tree can be log2(n+1).
- A binary tree with L leaves has atleast | Log 2 L| + 1 levels.
