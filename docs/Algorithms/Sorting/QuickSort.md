# QuickSort

QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.

QuickSort works on the principle of divide and conquer, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

There are mainly three steps in the algorithm:

1. Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).
2. Partition the Array: Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.
3. Recursively Call: Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).
4. Base Case: The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.

```cpp
int partition(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
  
    // Choose the pivot
    int pivot = arr[high];
  
    // Index of smaller element and indicates 
    // the right position of pivot found so far
    int i = low - 1;

    // Traverse arr[;ow..high] and move all smaller
    // elements on left side. Elements from low to 
    // i are smaller after every iteration
    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Move pivot after smaller elements and
    // return its position
    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);  
    return i + 1;
}

// The QuickSort function implementation
void quickSort(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
  
    if (low < high) {
      
        // pi is the partition return index of pivot
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        // Recursion calls for smaller elements
        // and greater or equals elements
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}
```
