# Introduction

## Types of Operating System
- **Single Task Operating System** - They allow one process to be present in RAM with running state. eg - MS-DOS. If a process waiting for IO and CPU is idle then this OS will not place any other process in place till the time it finished even if its idle.
- **Multi Programming and MultiTasking Operating System** - This OS allows multiple processes in RAM at a time and if one process is not using CPU then it will assign CPU to other one.
Multiprogramming is the idea of having multiple processes at the same time in the memory and run them in an interleaved fashion. In Multi-tasking we run the processes in time slot manner. 
- **MultiThreading Operating System** - MultiThreading is interleaving of threads with in the process. Thread is smallest unit of work which can be assigned to CPU. Switching between threads is less costly then switching between process.
- **Mutiprocess Operating System** - Multiprocess operating system has support for multiple processes.
- **MutiUser Operating System** -
