# SOLID Principles of OOP's

```
S - Single Responsiblity Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segmented Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
```

- **Single Responsibility System** - `A class should have one reason to change.` Making code modular such that each module has only one specific task.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - `Open for extension but closed for modification.` If a class is already working/live we should not modify it, instead we can do extension.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** - `If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace the object of A with B without breaking th behaviour of program.` Subclass should always extend the capabilities of Parent class not narrow it down.
- **Interface Segmented Principle** - `Interfaces should be such that client should not implement unnnecessary functions which they do not need.` Parent class should be modular such that its child doesn't have to implement unneccessary function.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** - `Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class.`

## Advantages of Solid date

- Help us write better code
- Avoid Duplicate Code
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible Software
- Reduce Complexity
